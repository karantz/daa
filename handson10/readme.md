Binary Search Tree (BST): An unbalanced binary tree where all nodes follow the left-child < parent < right-child rule. This will include insert, delete, search, and traversal methods.

Red-Black Tree (RBT): A balanced binary search tree that enforces specific color and rotation properties to maintain balance, ensuring efficient operations.

AVL Tree: Another balanced binary search tree that uses height balancing to ensure each node has a balanced sub-tree. It also guarantees efficient operations with additional height checking and rotations after insertion or deletion.

Each tree will be tested for:

Insertion: Adding elements and verifying tree properties.
Deletion: Removing elements and ensuring balance or structure.
Search: Checking for the presence of elements.
Traversal: In-order traversal to verify sorted order.
