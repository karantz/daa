Heap Implementation
This project implements a generic Heap class in Python.

This Python implementation supports:

A generic heap structure, allowing for various data types (can store floats, int).
The min-heap property where the smallest element is always the root.
Heap operations:
Inserting new elements into the heap.
Popping the root element and restoring the heap property.
Building a min-heap from an unsorted/ random array.
Retrieving the root element of the heap without removal.

Output:
Initial heap:
Heap: [1, 100, 30, 499, 800, 71]

Heap after inserting 0:
Heap: [0, 100, 1, 499, 800, 71, 30]

Popped root: 0
Heap after popping root:
Heap: [1, 100, 30, 499, 800, 71]

Current root: 1
