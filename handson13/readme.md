# Hands on 13
I've implemented the three algorithms you requested:

## Topological Sort:

- Uses depth-first search to perform topological sorting
- Works on a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
-Returns a linear ordering of vertices


## Depth-First Search (DFS):

- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- Can start from any given vertex
- Returns the path of visited vertices


## Kruskal's Algorithm:

- Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph
- Uses a disjoint-set data structure to detect cycles
- Sorts edges by weight and greedily adds the lowest weight edges
