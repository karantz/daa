# Dynamic Array Implementation

This project implements a dynamic array (similar to `std::vector` in C++) using Python. The dynamic array resizes automatically when it reaches capacity, and the program provides both a text-based user interface (UI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the array.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array Operations:**
  - `push_back`: Adds an element to the end of the array.
  - `pop_back`: Removes the last element from the array.
  - `get_size`: Returns the number of elements in the array.
  - `get_capacity`: Returns the current capacity of the array.
  - Index-based access (`array[index]`) for viewing and setting elements.
  
- **Interfaces:**
  - **Text-Based Interface**: Allows users to interact with the array in a terminal or command prompt.
